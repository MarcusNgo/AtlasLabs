# AtlasLabs
"The core goal of this case study is to build a report using fictitious datasets from a Tech company called Atlas Labs. Atlas Labs HR team want to be able to monitor key metrics on employees. Their secondary goal is to understand what factors impact employee attrition.

From our dataset, the fact table stores the Performance Ratings. This table contains information about employees yearly reviews and helps Atlas Labs manage their employees performance on a regular basis. This is the central point of our snowflake schema. It contains 11 different columns and has multiple rows per employee.

For this case study we will be working with multiple dimension tables. It enables us to provide more context to the data - the who, what, when, where, and why. We have five dimension tables that we will be working with: Employee, EducationLevel, RatingLevel, SatisfiedLevel, and Date. We will be creating the date table in a future exercise and it will contain detailed information such as year, quarter, month, and day."
